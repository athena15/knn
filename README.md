Created a project to automatically perform the k-nearest neighbors (knn) workflow on a dataset with a specified target column as the dependent variable.

Wine.py demonstrates import and use of the nearest_neighbors_workflow function on a dataset of different wines, classifying them as high-alcohol or low-alcohol. Just a simple example of how the function is used.
